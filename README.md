# Images in Emails :

To avoid issues with external images being blocked, you can embed the image directly into the email using Base64 encoding. This encodes the image as a string of text and embeds it within the email itself, so thereâ€™s no need to load it from an external server.

Example of embedding an image using Base64:

<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA..." alt="Embedded Image">
